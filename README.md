#Use the issues page or [join me on Discord](https://discord.gg/zU9HFm7) for suggestions or issues.
####If you have any links to games(show up in your browser when you're playing a game, just exit fullscreen), feel free to share them [here](https://github.com/soap-less/stadiajson/issues). They're very important to this project, and I am still missing a lot of them.


# What is this thing?
StadiaRPC is an **UNOFFICIAL** Google Chrome extension made for Stadia users which uses Discord Rich Presence to display what games you are currently playing.

# Getting Started
Getting started is really easy! Well not like super easy, but it's easy enough. 
1. Head over to https://github.com/lolamtisch/Discord-RPC-Extension.
2. Download BOTH the Chrome extension and the Desktop application. They are both required for the plugin to work.
3. Download the StadiaRPC Chrome extension file from the Chrome web store(AWAITING APPROVAL).

# Waiting approval?
Yeah, my legal disclaimer I made to cover my ass got my plugin flagged by the Chrome store, and now they have to review it(it might not even go through...). If you're really desperate to use it, though, don't worry! While I do recommend you wait, there's a way to use it right now. First, download and extract the master.zip file. Then, go to chrome://extensions in your browser and turn on developer mode. Finally, hit the "Load unpacked" button and select the extracted folder. You're now good to go.

# Credits/Rights
Huge shoutout to @lolamtisch for making the DiscordRPC/Chrome API. This project would be a hell of a lot harder without them.
